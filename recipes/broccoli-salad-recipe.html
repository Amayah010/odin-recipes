        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Broccoli salad is a classic summer cookout dish, but the traditional recipe is loaded up with sugar, ample mayo, and cheese.</p>
        <p>This is a healthier spin on the traditional midwest broccoli salad but it’s every bit as flavorful. Small broccoli florets are marinated in a creamy/tangy dressing along with dried cranberries and smoky tamari-roasted almonds. It’s a one-bowl recipe that’s great as a pack-able picnic salad or an easy make-ahead lunch.</p>
